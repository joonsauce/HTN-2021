# About the Project
MemorAudio challenges your attention and ability to remember thing people tell you! You start off meeting some new people and learning a fact about them. Every once in a while, you will encounter some people who will also ask about what you have learned about someone you've met before. Everytime you help them out and answer truthfully, you get a point! Pay close attention as things get trickier and info gets harder to remember!
# Usage
Before you begin, you need to have a CockroachCloud cluster. You will need an account, a cluster, and an SQL user.

You will also need a Voiceflow account and some action ready. We used the Google Assistant action.

You need to host the two different APIs in their respective directories. The `Random API` connects the `HTN 2021 Backend` to the front-end. To use `HTN 2021 Backend`, do `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the python requirements. You will also need to install the CockroachDB CLI, which is outlined on your cluster's website.

# About the Project

# Usage
The bot is *customizable*; it is configured to your taste for your own server. This means that I don't provide anywhere to 
host the bot, you have to find it yourself. To host you can just run `bot.py` in your choice of IDE or find a hosting provider.
All of the commands have been designed to be customized, guides for customizing all of them will come soon. The default prefix 
to use the bot is `s!`, but you can change that in `setting.py`.
